Updated and improved version of the Sparse Lens Inversion Technique (`SLIT <https://github.com/herjy/SLIT>`_), developed within the framework of lens modelling software `lenstronomy <https://github.com/sibirrer/lenstronomy>`_.

The documentation is available on `readthedocs.org <http://slitronomy.readthedocs.org/>`_ (currently in development).


Installation
============

This package is available through PyPi.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install slitronomy --user



Requirements
============

In addition to standard packages listed in `requirements.txt <https://github.com/aymgal/SLITronomy/tree/master/requirements.txt>`_, lenstronomy needs to be installed to access to python classes for proper initialisation of SLITronomy solvers.

The most straghtforward way to use pixel-based solvers of SLITronomy is directly through lenstronomy (version >=1.6.0), by using the `'SLIT_STARLETS'` light profiles. SLITronomy can also be used as a standalone tool.
